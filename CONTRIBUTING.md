When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache-2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SKocur/Image-Cipher/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SKocur/Image-Cipher/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style.
