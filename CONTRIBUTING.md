## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same 
[Apache-2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SKocur/Image-Cipher/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SKocur/Image-Cipher/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

### How to develop ImageCipher?
1. Choose issue that is opened and not associated to anyone **or** propose something to develop.
2. Branch out from current master and name your branch like develop/{your_username}/{name_of_issue/issue_id}
3. After you finished developing push your code to new remote branch named like your local branch.
4. Create Pull Request to merge your changes into `master` branch.
5. Java CI (Continuous Integration) runner will try to compile the project source code.
6. If Java CI task completes successfully, you can assign your PR to some mantainer to let them review your code and then eventually merge your changes.
